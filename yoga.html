          <h5>Helps Manage Stress</h5>
          <div class="pra">
            <p>Yoga encourages you to turn inwards and create awareness of the outside factors that cause you stress.
              When you practise
              regularly, you'll start to understand how the breathing techniques, stillness and heat of the room help
              your body and mind relax.</p>

          <h5>Boosts Concentration, Focus & Memory</h5>
          <div class="pra">
            <p>Do you find it hard to focus on certain daily tasks? Then giving yoga a try could help you regain the
              ability to get things done efficiently without getting distracted! Yoga can definitely boost concentration
              and memory because you have to focus during your practice.

          <h5>Self-Care</h5>
          <div class="pra">
            <p>In a fast-moving world, people not only leave behind their morals and their loved ones, but they also
              forget about themselves. Yoga makes a person meet him or herself again. It makes a person remember that
              self-care is as important as caring about your most beloved thing in life.</p>

        <img src="Image/child pose.jpg">
        <div class="explanation">
          <h4>Pose #1: Child's Pose (Balasana)</h4>
          <p>This calming pose is a good default pause position. You can use child’s pose to rest and refocus before
            continuing to your next pose. It gently stretches your lower back, hips, thighs, knees and ankles and
            relaxes
            your spine, shoulders and neck.
          </p>

          <p><b>How to do it:</b><br>
            Seat on your heels, the tops of your feet pressing into the mat or floor, and pressing your chest toward
            your
            thighs. Then, extend your arms forward, with your palms facing either upwards or downwards.</p>

            <h4>Pose #2: Corpse Pose (Savasana)</h4>
            <div style="width: 90%;">
              <p>Move into the ultimate state of relaxation in Corpse Pose. This pose allows you to let go, easing the
                physical tension and mental stress you’re holding onto throughout your entire body. Normally, yoga
                practices
                will end with this pose.</p>

              <p><b>How to do it:</b><br>
                Separate your legs apart by hip distance and release any tension in your body. But don't forget to face
                your
                palms upwards. Just relax your whole body and let your breathing occur naturally.</p>

          <h4>Pose #3: Legs-Up-The-Wall Pose (Viparita Karani)</h4>
          <p>This pose is one of the greatest poses for settling the nervous system. In other words, it can move you
            from
            fight-or-flight to rest-and-digest, releasing tension and helping you to unwind. Keen to have a peaceful
            night
            of sleep? Then don't miss it!</p>

          <p><b>How to do it:</b><br>
            Raise your legs straight, resting against the wall at right angle to the torso. Tuck your tailbone as close
            to
            a wall as you can and rest your back and head on the ground with your arms relaxed.</p>

              <p>One of yoga's most widely known pose, this pose lengthens and stretches the posterior chain of the
                body,
                including the calves, hamstrings, glutes and back. It is an inversion as the head is below the heart,
                which
                can have a calming effect.</p>
              <p><b>How to do it:</b><br>
                Get down on all fours. Start on the floor with your shoulders above your wrists. Then, lift your knees
                and
                tuck your toes against the mat or ground. Your body should now resemble an upside-down “V” shape.</p>

              <p>A slightly challenging yet effective pose, <em>Anahatasana</em> is known as a heart-opening yoga pose
                that
                energizes the whole body. It offers amazing mental benefits, including developing compassion, elevating

          <h4>Pose #7: Tree Pose (Vrksasana)</h4>
          <p>For many of us, feelings of stress causes us to feel weak and unstable in both body and mind. Standing
            balancing postures like this one are a very tangible way to reconnect to your roots, find your stable
            center,
            and grow a feeling of power and strength.</p>

          <p><b>How to do it:</b><br>
            In standing position, lift your left foot, bend your left knee and bring the sole of your left foot high
            onto
            your inner right thigh. Focus your gaze on something that doesn't move to help you keep your balance.</p>

            <div style="width: 90%;">
              <p>The Bridge Pose is an inverted back-bending asana in hatha yoga and modern yoga as exercise. It
                stretches our
                chest, neck, spine, and
                hips and also calms the brain and central nervous system effectively, which helps in alleviating stress
                and
                also mild depression.</p>

              <p><b>How to do it:</b><br>
                Lie on your back with your knees bent, your legs and feet parallel. Move your feet closer to your
                buttocks.

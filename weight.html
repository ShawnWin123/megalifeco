          <h1>Gain weight</h1>
          <p>Being underweight is defined as having a body mass index (BMI) below 18.5. This is estimated to be less
            than the body mass needed to sustain optimal health. Whatever your reasons are for wanting to gain weight,
            there are a variety of strategies you can use to bulk up. Below, we’ve outlined several different ways to
            help you gain weight.

          <h2>Increase Your Caloric Intake</h2>
          <p>The most important thing you can do to gain weight is to create a <b>calorie surplus</b>, meaning you eat
            more calories than your body needs. For example, if your body burns 2000 kcals per day, you need to increase
            your calorie intake to 2400 kcals in order to gain weight. If you want to gain weight safely and healthily,
            aim for 300–500 calories more than you burn each day and don't eat too much junk food as it will lead to
            disease. </p>

              <p>Protein forms the building blocks of your muscles. Eating sufficient protein is required to gain muscle
                weight in addition to other nutrients. However, protein may also reduce your hunger and appetite
                significantly, making it harder to get in enough calories. </p>

          <p>Many people try restricting either carbs or fat when trying to lose weight. This may make it hard to gain
            weight, as it will make it harder to get in enough calories. Eat plenty of high carb and high fat foods if
            weight gain is a priority for you. It is best to eat plenty of protein, fat, and carbs at each meal. Make
            sure to eat at least three meals per day and try to add energy-dense snacks whenever possible.</p>

              <p>Resistance training leads to muscle hypertrophy, which increases muscle mass. Combining protein
                supplementation with resistance training can promote additional gains in lean body mass beyond those
                gained by resistance exercise alone. One study found that protein supplementation during resistance
                training for six weeks increased lean mass growth by 27% in healthy adults. You can try our <a

        <h2>10 Useful Hacks and Tricks</h2>
        <div class="tips_li">
          <li>Avoid drinking water before meals. This can fill your stomach and make it harder to get in enough calories
          </li>
          <li>Eat more often. Squeeze in an additional meal or snack whenever you can, such as before bed.</li>
          <li>Drink milk. Drinking whole milk to quench thirst can be a simple way to get in more high quality protein
            and calories.</li>
          <li>Try weight gainer shakes. If you are having trouble gaining weight, consider weight gainer shakes. These
            are very high in protein, carbs, and calories.</li>
          <li>Use bigger plates. Consider using large plates if you’re trying to get in more calories, as smaller plates
            can cause people to eat less.</li>
          <li>Add cream to your coffee. This is a simple way to add in more calories.</li>
          <li>Take creatine. The muscle-building supplement creatine monohydrate can help you gain a few pounds in
            muscle weight</li>
          <li>Get quality sleep. Sleeping properly is very important for muscle growth.</li>
          <li>Eat your protein and fat source first. If you have a mix of foods on your plate, eat the calorie-dense and
            protein-rich foods first. Eat higher fiber foods like raw vegetables last.</li>
          <li>Focus on eating more nutrient-dense foods and living an overall healthy lifestyle that involves
            exercising, getting enough sleep, and reducing stress, if you can.</li>

          <h1>Lose weight</h1>
          <p>Being overweight is defined as having a body mass index (BMI) over 25.0. This is defined as abnormal or
            excessive fat accumulation that presents a risk to health. If you want to lose weight quickly, some of these
            tips may help, but quick weight loss is rarely sustainable. Focusing on long-term health and habits that you

          <h2>Calorie Deficit</h2>
          <p>One way to help lose weight quickly is to cut back on sugars and starches, or carbohydrates. This could be
            with a low carb eating plan or by reducing refined carbs and replacing them with whole grains. With a low
            carb eating plan, you’ll utilize burning stored fat for energy instead of carbs.</p>

          <h2>Move Your Body</h2>
          <p>Although exercise is not required for losing weight, but it will help you from burning more calories.
            Lifting weight is recommended because it will prevent you from lowering your metabolism and losing muscle
            while losing weight. If lifting weights is not an option for you, doing some cardio workouts such as
            walking, jogging, running, cycling, or swimming is very beneficial for weight loss and general health.</p>

        <h2>10 Useful Hacks and Tricks</h2>
        <div class="tips_li">
          <li>Eat a high protein breakfast. Eating a high protein breakfast could help reduce cravings and calorie
            intake throughout the day</li>
          <li>Limit sugary drinks and fruit juice. Empty calories from sugar aren’t useful to your body and can hinder
            weight loss</li>
          <li>Stay hydrated. Drink water throughout the day and aim for half your body weight in ounces</li>
          <li>Choose weight-loss-friendly foods. Some foods are better for weight loss than others.</li>
          <li>Eat more fiber. Studies show that eating fiber may promote weight loss. Find fiber in whole grains,
            fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds and these other high-fiber foods. </li>
          <li>Drink coffee or tea. Caffeine consumption may help boost your metabolism. No need to go overboard on
            caffeine though and be mindful of adding sugar to these drinks</li>
          <li>Base your diet on whole foods. They tend to be nutrient rich, more filling, and less likely to cause
            overeating than processed foods.</li>
          <li>Eat slowly. Eating quickly can lead to weight gain over time, while eating slowly makes you feel more full
            and boosts weight-reducing hormones</li>
          <li>Get good quality sleep. Sleep is important for many reasons, and poor sleep is one of the biggest risk
            factors for weight gain</li>
          <li>If you opt for a low carb eating plan, it’s not necessary to count calories as long as you keep your carb
            intake low and eat mostly protein, fat, and low carb vegetables</li>
